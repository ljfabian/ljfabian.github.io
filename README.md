# Bioinformatics notebook
## What is this? 
This is a general resourcen of different code snippets from my time working within Bioinformatics. This is  to act as documentation for myself, so if/when I need to re-visit some general basic or simple tasks in the future I have a single place to look.

This will include snippets and links from official documentation of variety of softwares and other locations. These will be The most appropriate sources of information, especially when issues might arise. I am just collecting and condensing information I find useful within this field. It by no means covers everything and there will always be alternate ways to do tasks which may or may not be more efficient. 

Some questions worth asking when starting a piece of work:
- How often are you going to be doing a task?
- How easy is it to change and adapt?
- How specialised is this going to be?
- How much time will optimizing the code take, vs the time it will save (culmulatively)? (YAGNI)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it]

### My experience:
- Current: I work as a Bioinformatics and Biobank data specialist at the university of Bristol. Specifically for the Children of the 90s study, otherwise known as Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). 
- 2021-22: Masters in Bioinformatics with Genetic Epidemiology at Cardiff University.
- 2019-2021: Operations Analyst at Arm ltd (2019-2021).
- 2015-2019: Undergraduate Biology with proffessional placement year at the University of Bath. My placement year (2017-2018) was conducted at the Frozen Ark Project, located within the University of Cardiff.
